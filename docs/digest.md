## Rails 7. Startkit

### Week 1. Part 4

One person asked me why I have an app with so many preiinstalled tools. Like, if you need something you will install it later your self.

Yes, it is possible. But, again. All the time you need to choose a solution. You need to set it up and configure. You need to a lot of boring work.

I have my own short list of must have tools. This list is stable for years. Why I should not have a ready-to-go project?

How can I start a new project without Sidekiq? Wihtout Caching and Redis, wihtout pagination and cron tasks? I'm sure my app will use Devise and Mailers. Why should I waste time on it every single time?

Even if some people do not accept the idea to have an MVP app with many preinstalled must have tools - I see a lot of benifits from it.

Going to continue.

### Week 1. Part 3

I should add to the table not only tools what I've already preinstalled, but also tools what I want to install later.

Maybe someone will help me to manage something. Looks like a good idea.

### Week 1. Part 2

People ask why I used in Elastic and Sphinx in the project. The answer is simple - I do the project for myself to learn things and have them preinstalled if I would like to start any new Rails project.

I worked with Sphinx and never worked with ElasticSeach. That is why I investigated how to use them.

But people are absolutely right. It is a confusing thing. I should grt rid of Sphinx. I will move it to a new branch. To have it only if I really need.

I work hardly on Readme and documentation. But all the time it is not perfect. I'm trying to make it short, simple and helpful. Still working on it. Will see if it helps to promote the project.

### Week 1. Part 1

I've started development of my Rails 7 playground.

I didn't use Rails last 4 or even 5 years. Many new technologies I want to check and learn. Also I have my own vision about a minimal Rails app.

3 days I needed to setup my MVP. Just a draft with using Docker, gem Config, Redis, Sidekiq etc.

I've installed Sphinx and Thinking Sphinx. I worked with this tool some years ago and I wanted to see if it is still a good solution for Rails. Looks like it still works.

First time I used Elastic Search. I think there is a case I need to solve - something about setting up password due to security reasons. Valid point, but not now. Maybe Later someone will help to improve it.

I've started actively use `bin/` folder. Executable scripts from here helps a lot to automatize processes and hide implementation details.

I've started to inform people about my project. Got first and very positive feedback.

Looks like my 1 week vaccation will be crashed, because I really inspired by the project and going to spend some time on it this week.
